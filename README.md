## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository and install the package

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webview-checker.git
cd webview-checker
pip install .
2Ô∏è‚É£ Set your Shodan API key
To use the Shodan API, you must first set your API key as an environment variable.

You can obtain a Shodan API key by following the steps below

How to get your Shodan API key
Sign up or log in to Shodan.io.
After logging in, go to your Account page.
Copy your API Key from the dashboard.


Set the API Key as an environment variable

For Windows (PowerShell)
$env:SHODAN_API_KEY="your_shodan_api_key"


For Windows (CMD)
set SHODAN_API_KEY="your_shodan_api_key"


For macOS/Linux (bash)
export SHODAN_API_KEY="your_shodan_api_key"


3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the CLI tool
1. Analyze an IP address (using Shodan API)
webview-checker --ip 1.1.1.1


2. Scrape Google Play Store
webview-checker --url https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app


3. Analyze both IP and URL simultaneously
webview-checker --ip 1.1.1.1 --url https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app


üõ†Ô∏è Components
Shodan API Analysis: The module app/shodan_checker.py interacts with the Shodan API to analyze the provided IP address and gather web server information (e.g., open ports, server types).

Google Play Store Scraping: The module app/scraper.py scrapes the app page and detects whether the app uses web technologies such as WebView, JavaScript, or HTML.

CLI Interface: cli.py allows users to easily access both the Shodan and scraping functionalities through command-line options.

üéâ Why Use WebView Checker?
üåç Combined Analysis: It merges network-level data (Shodan API) with app metadata (Google Play Store) for a comprehensive analysis.

üîç Fast and Convenient: With just one command, you can simultaneously analyze IP addresses and app URLs, providing a clear view of possible WebView usage.

üõ°Ô∏è Useful for Security Experts: This tool can be extremely helpful for security experts analyzing IoT devices or investigating whether companion apps use web technologies, which could present certain vulnerabilities.

üîß Automated: No need to manually query Shodan or Google Play Store data. This tool automates everything for you.
