## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository and install the package

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webview-checker.git
cd webview-checker
pip install .

2️⃣ Set your Shodan API key
export SHODAN_API_KEY="your_shodan_api_key"


3️⃣ Run the CLI tool
1. Analyze an IP address (using Shodan API)
webview-checker --ip 1.1.1.1

2. Scrape Google Play Store
webview-checker --url https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app

3. Analyze both IP and URL simultaneously
webview-checker --ip 1.1.1.1 --url https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app


🛠️ Components
Shodan API Analysis: The module app/shodan_checker.py interacts with the Shodan API to analyze the provided IP address and gather web server information (e.g., open ports, server types).

Google Play Store Scraping: The module app/scraper.py scrapes the app page and detects whether the app uses web technologies such as WebView, JavaScript, or HTML.
CLI Interface: cli.py allows users to easily access both the Shodan and scraping functionalities through command-line options.


🎉 Why Use WebView Checker?

🌍 Combined Analysis: It merges network-level data (Shodan API) with app metadata (Google Play Store) for a comprehensive analysis.


🔍 Fast and Convenient: With just one command, you can simultaneously analyze IP addresses and app URLs, providing a clear view of possible WebView usage.


🛡️ Useful for Security Experts: This tool can be extremely helpful for security experts analyzing IoT devices or investigating whether companion apps use web technologies, which could present certain vulnerabilities.


🔧 Automated: No need to manually query Shodan or Google Play Store data. This tool automates everything for you.
